# Predicting House Prices in West Yorkshire
 
## Objective: 
- Create a property price prediction function for properties within the major cities/towns of West Yorkshire
- Those locations are: Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield, Halifax and Wakefield

## Tasks:
1) Webscrape property listings information from rightmove.co.uk for each location 
2) Clean data and perform exploratory data analysis
3) Model the data in order to perform price prediction (using regression techniques)
4) Build a function using model(s) trained via step 3

This project was undertaken from the 22/03/23 - 31/03/23. This project required me to use and build on the knowledge I 
gained during my time on the Data Specialist Academy at Digital Futures. Upon completion of this project, I
presented my project to my peers and instructors.
